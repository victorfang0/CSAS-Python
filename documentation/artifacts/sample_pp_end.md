# Artifact: Sample Power Play End

**File:** `sample_pp_end.png`
**Type:** Visualization (PNG)

## What this is
A single-frame snapshot of a real Power Play end from our dataset. It shows the initial placement of the "Pre-Placed Stones" before any rocks are thrown.

## Key Features
*   **The Corner Guard:** You can see a stone placed to the side of the centerline (Left or Right), guarding the "Wing" of the house.
*   **The House Stone:** A second stone is placed inside the house, behind the Teeline.
*   **The "Open" Center:** Notice how the center of the ice (where play usually happens) is completely empty. This visualizes the "Chaos/Openness" concept discussed in Step 1.

## Why we generated this
We created this image during the verification phase (Step 5) to confirm our coordinate system was correct. By seeing the stones land exactly where the rulebook says they should be (on the Wing), we proved that `x=765` was indeed the center.
